## Tech Breakfast

Monthly event – on each first Wednesday of the month – where we see quick showcases of entrepreneurial ideas as we cosily sip the first morning coffee. A couple of five-minute presentations, two-minute Q&A sessions, and networking, made complete by the flavour of [Domaće kiflice](http://domacekiflice.rs/), is a terrific way to start your day.

[Tech Breakfast](https://tehnoloskidorucak.io/ "Tehnološki doručak") is the place to exchange ideas, and you can apply to take part, just like with any other Heapspace project. No matter whether you’re a coder, designer, entrepreneur or a marketer, come show your idea and inspire others!

If you want to share your idea, write to us at: [dorucak@heapspace.rs](mailto:dorucak@heapspace.rs).
