## Tech Breakfast

Launched in December 2015, Tech breakfast showcases entrepreneurial ideas as we cosily sip the first morning coffee. A couple of five-minute presentations, two-minute Q&A sessions, and networking, made complete by the flavour of [Domaće kiflice](http://domacekiflice.rs/), is a terrific way to start your day.

In September 2018, Tech breakfast event takes place in Zagreb and Novi Sad and in 2019. Niš, Osijek and Subotica will be hosting this morning event.

[Tech Breakfast](https://tehnoloskidorucak.io/ "Tehnološki doručak") is the place to exchange ideas, and you can apply to take part, just like with any other Heapspace project. No matter whether you’re a coder, designer, entrepreneur or a marketer, come show your idea and inspire others!

If you want to share your idea, write to us at: [dorucak@heapspace.rs](mailto:dorucak@heapspace.rs).
