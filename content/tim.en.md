# Meet the team

Our team consists of professionals with different backgrounds.

Heapspace carries the rich heritage of its predecessor, the JavaSvet community, and since 2004 we’ve been constantly building it, brought together by the idea that acquiring knowledge changes the mindset and the world.

Maybe you’ve had the chance to meet us as organisers of the first Devoxx conference in this part of the Europe – Voxxed Days Belgrade, or the authors of the Tech Breakfast and Heapcon event.
