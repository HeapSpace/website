We are Heapspace. Since 2004 we’ve been working on the development of local and regional tech environment.

Together with other organisations and companies, we create a habitat where business can thrive. We have overseen the organisation of over 100 events. For three consecutive years, we’ve organised one of the biggest tech conferences in the Balkans – Heapcon.

The year of 2019. has many more exciting projects in store.
