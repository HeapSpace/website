## CyberAvocado

[www.cyberavocado.rs](http://www.cyberavocado.rs/)

CyberAvocado is a small team of lawyers dedicated to provide niche legal services to companies, entrepreneurs, startups and NGOs.

Specific legal expertise and sophisticated knowledge on how IT, media and other creative industries function, enables us to understand our client’s products and offer effective legal solutions in areas of IT, IP, corporate, data protection, media and competition law.

We nurture friendly and honest communication with our clients, offering them not only legal, but commercial advice.

CyberAvocado is proud to partner up with Heapspace, since we belong to the same community and wish to contribute together to further development and promotion of IT and tech entrepreneurship in Serbia.


## Hooloovoo

HOOLOOVOO is made of good people and senior programmers and we all think Belgrade is a place for a big IT conference. That's how it all happened - cooperation, trust and support. We believe Heapcon is as important for Serbia as Exit is.
